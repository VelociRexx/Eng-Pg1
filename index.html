      Movie adaptations of treasured novels or comics are very difficult to pull
      off. There are many adaptations from novels to movies that do the change
      well, incorporating the themes of the novel into the movie and creating a
      successful product as a result. Other movies change too many things, or
      just don’t create an entertaining enough story, and leave the audiences
      disappointed with the end product. A huge part of adapting written stories
      to movies is keeping the themes from the source. Keeping the novel’s
      themes can almost guarantee a success from the fans. Dropping the themes
      to basically create your own story with an already existing IP will only
      destroy the chances of making a successful movie. These following two
      movies are two different ways you can adapt and keep the themes the same,
      and the third example is what will happen if you do happen to change the
      themes of the story
